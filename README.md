# Mirror Image Number Pattern Using Java

Java pattern program enhances the coding skill, logic, and looping concepts. It is mostly asked in Java interview to check the logic and thinking of the programmer. We can print a Java pattern program in different designs. To learn the pattern program, we must have a deep knowledge of the Java loop, such as for loop do-while loop. 

In geometry, the mirror image of an object or two-dimensional figure is the virtual image formed by reflection in a plane mirror; it is of the same size as the original object, yet different, unless the object or figure has reflection symmetry (also known as a P-symmetry).

In this section, we will learn how to print a Mirror image pattern in Java.

The output of the Mirror image pattern will be as shown.
